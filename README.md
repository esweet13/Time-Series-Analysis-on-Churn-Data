# Time-Series-Analysis-on-Churn-Data

INTRODUCTION

As a data analyst, you will assess continuing data sources for their relevance to specific research questions throughout your career.
In your previous coursework, you have performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on your data. You have seen basic trends and patterns and now want to start building more sophisticated statistical models. In this course, you will use time series modeling. We will explore time series models and their implications.

For this task, you will select one of the Data Sets and Associated Data Dictionaries from the following link:
Data Sets and Associated Data Dictionaries

After you choose your organizational data set, you will review the data dictionary and considerations related to the raw data file you have chosen and prepare the data for time series modeling. You will then analyze that data set using time series modeling, create visualizations, generate forecasts, and deliver the results of your analysis.

REQUIREMENTS

Choose one of the data files and corresponding spreadsheet provided in the Web Links section and use the information to complete the following:

Part I: Research Question

A. Describe the purpose of this data analysis by doing the following:
1. Summarize one research question that is relevant to a real-world organizational situation captured in
the selected data set and that you will answer using time series modeling techniques.
2. Define the objectives or goals of the data analysis. Ensure that your objectives or goals are reasonable
within the scope of the scenario and are represented in the available data.

Part II: Method Justification

B. Summarize the assumptions of a time series model including stationarity and autocorrelated data.

Part III: Data Preparation

C. Summarize the data cleaning process by doing the following:
1. Provide a line graph visualizing the realization of the time series.
2. Describe the time step formatting of the realization, including any gaps in measurement and the length
of the sequence.
3. Evaluate the stationarity of the time series.
4. Explain the steps used to prepare the data for analysis, including the training and test set split.
5. Provide a copy of the cleaned dataset.

Part IV: Model Identification and Analysis

D. Analyze the time series dataset by doing the following:
1. Report the annotated findings with visualizations of your data analysis, including the following
elements:
• the presence or lack of aseasonal component
• trends
• autocorrelation function
• spectral density
• the decomposed time series
• confirmation of the lack of trends in the residuals of the decomposed series
2. Identify an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model that takes into account the observed trend and seasonality of the time series data.
3. Perform a forecast using the derived ARIMA model.
4. Provide the output and calculations of the analysis you performed.
5. Provide the code used to support the implementation of the time series model.

Part V: Data Summary and Implications

E. Summarize your findings and assumptions, including the following points: 1. Discuss the results of your data analysis, including the following:
• the selection of an ARIMAmodel
• the prediction interval of the forecast
• a justification of the forecast length
• the model evaluation procedure and error metric
2. Provide an annotated visualization of the forecast of the final model compared to the test set.
3. Recommend a course of action based on your results.

Part VI: Reporting

F. Create your report from part E using an industry-relevant interactive development environment (e.g., an R Markdown document, a Jupyter Notebook, etc.). Include a PDF or HTML document of your executed notebook presentation.
